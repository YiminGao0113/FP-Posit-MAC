# FP16-POSIT4 MAC Unit

## Project Overview

This project implements a **FP16-POSIT4 MAC (Multiply-Accumulate) Unit** that computes MAC operations using **shift-and-add** in a **bit-serial fashion**. The unit is designed to efficiently perform mixed-precision arithmetic for machine learning and other hardware-accelerated applications.

### Key Features:
- Supports **FP16** and variable-precision **Posit** arithmetic.
- Computes **MAC operations** using a shift-and-add technique.
- **Bit-serial** implementation to reduce area and power consumption in hardware.
- Verilog implementation for simulation and hardware integration.

## Tools Required

- **Icarus Verilog (iverilog)**: Verilog compiler to compile the testbench and module.
- **GTKWave**: A waveform viewer to visualize the simulation output.

You can install these tools as follows:

### Installing Icarus Verilog (iverilog) and GTKWave
- On Ubuntu:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install iverilog gtkwave
  ```
- On macOS:
  ```bash
  brew install iverilog gtkwave
  ```

## How to Run the Simulation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/FP16-POSIT4-MAC.git
   cd FP16-POSIT4-MAC
   ```
2. Run the simulation: (e.g. to simulate fp_posit_mul unit run make fp_posit_mul)
   ```bash
   make design_name
   ```
3. Expected Results should show that the results passed simulation verification.
4. If you want to observe the generated waveform, run gtkwave:
   ```bash
   gtkwave build/design_name.vcd
   ```
5. To clean the generated temp files:
   ```bash
   make clean
   ```

## To do
- Finish the Accumulation module for Posit
- Implement and verify the entire MAC operation
- Implement and verify the bit-serial weight stream FP-POSIT MAC unit
- Implement and verify the MAC unit for Posit4
- Integrate synthesis flow into the Repo
